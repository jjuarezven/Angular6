            Subject.next() does the same like EventEmitter.emit(): It emits an event. EventEmitter extends Subject, thus they are very similar and often interchangeable. The official docs recommend to use EventEmitter only in directives and components, in connection
            with @Output(), and to use Subjects in services instead.
